# Proposals

Although Windranger aims to provide a modular framework for DAO governance, we will adopt and experiment
with a few simple approaches.

## Process #1

1. Propose on forum
2. If forum responses appear positive, create snapshot governance proposal
3. If governance proposal passes, manually execute transactions contained in the proposal

Advantages:

- Provides mechanisms for community feedback before transactions are executed
- Transactions are often explicitly included in a proposal, so exact actions can be easily verified
  after proposal execution
- Provides a path to automated execution as the process becomes more robust

## Process #2:

1. Snapshot signaling proposal
2. If signaling proposal passes, continue with Process #1 above

Advantages:

- Signaling proposal gets an accurate temperature check based on actual token holders

## Future Work

- potential for proposals to bubble downwards to linked-DAOs and/or to bubble upwards
